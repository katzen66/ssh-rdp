ssh-rdp
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ssh-rdp.sh is a shell script that allow you control an X11 remote desktop
from an X11 session with minimum latency with support 
for video and audio streaming.

Since the input control happens at low level by using netevent,
(https://github.com/Blub/netevent)
every input device can actually be forwarded to the remote host.
This means keyboards,mouses,joypads,racing wheels and so on, thus
allowing you to actually remotely play.

Apart from the ssh server, ssh-rdp does not require a specific server 
running on the remote side, but a set of tools needs to be present 
remotely and others locally.

Software requirements:
    * Local and Remote: bash,ffmpeg,openssh,netevent
    * Local: wmctrl, mpv >=0.29, taskset
    * Remote: xdpyinfo,pulseaudio
    * If you see Invalid MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1 key among the errors,
      then probably the remote system won't allow remote users
      to start local X11 applications.
      The easiest way to solve this is to execute the following
      command on the remote side: "xhost +local:"
      A convenient way to do that is via an autostart script
      executed automatically by your Desktop environment
      when the user does the local login.

Special requirements for input forwarding:
    * Local user need to access files under /dev/input,
      so make sure it is in the input group.
    * Remote user need access to special device /dev/uinput
      You can do that by install the provided 70-uinput.rules 
      into /etc/udev/rules.d on the remote side and reboot it.

Usage:
    To make it work, first start it with the "inputconfig" option 
    and pay attention to what it asks you.
    Next, start it with -h parameter alone to see all the options.

    There are other tunables you can find in the script.

Caveats:
    * Due to network problems, sometimes the audio could be desyncronized,
      it will recover by itself by speeding up, and could hear high-pitched sound.
    * Just clicking in the remote window does not pass the control to it, 
      because that is the player, so hitting the chosen hotkey is mandatory.
    * Have to pick screen blindly for wayland implementation.
    * Cannot use custom encode with pure gstreamer pipeline.
    * No visible cursor when using portals.

Suggestions:
    * For remote gaming, turning on cpu encoder may give better 
      results than gpu encoder, if the gpu is already at its limit.


Usage:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Use ssh-rdp.sh inputconfig to create or change the input config file

-s, --server        Remote host to connect to
-u, --user          ssh username
-p, --port          ssh port
    --sshopt        pass additional ssh option (omit -o)
-d, --display       Remote display (eg: 0.0)
-r, --resolution    Grab size (eg: 1920x1080) or AUTO
-o, --offset        Grab offset (eg: +1920,0)
    --follow        pan the grabbed area when the cursor reaches the border
    --prescale      Scale video before encoding (eg: 1280x720).
                    Has impact on remote cpu use and can increase latency too.
-f, --fps           Grabbed frames per second
    --pasource      Capture from the specified pulseaudio source. (experimental and may introduce delay)
                    Use AUTO to guess, use ALL to capture everything.
                    Eg: alsa_output.pci-0000_00_1b.0.analog-stereo.monitor

    --videoenc      Video encoder can be: cpu,cpurgb,amdgpu,amdgpu_hevc,intelgpu,nvgpu,nvgpu_hevc,zerocopy,custom,null or show
                    "zerocopy" is experimental and causes ffmpeg to use kmsgrab
                    to grab the framebuffer and pass frames to vaapi encoder.
                    You've to run 'setcap cap_sys_admin+ep /usr/bin/ffmpeg' on the server to use zerocopy.
                    --display, --follow are ignored when using zerocopy.
                    specify "show" to print the options for each preset.

    --use-portals   Use xdg-portals to pick a screen and start stream. Unneeded on X11, for capture with pipewire on Wayland.
                    You will have to pick the screen blindly, you'll be dropped with functional input but no video.
                    Can be used with ffmpeg (uses a fifo pipe to pass all other options to ffmpeg, laggy).
                    For a pure gstreamer pipeline specify gstreamer.

    --customv       Specify a string for video encoder stuff when videoenc is set to custom
                    Eg: "-threads 1 -c:v h264_nvenc -preset llhq -delay 0 -zerolatency 1"
    --audioenc      Audio encoder can be: opus,pcm,null,custom or show
                    "null" disables audio grabbing completely
                    specify "show" to print the options for each other preset.

    --customa       Specify a string for audio encoder stuff when videoenc is set to custom
                    Eg: "-acodec libopus -vbr off -application lowdelay"
-v, --vbitrate      Video bitrate in kbps or AUTO
                    AUTO will use 80% of the maximum available throughput.
-a, --abitrate      Audio bitrate in kbps
    --vplayeropts   Additional options to pass to videoplayer
                    Eg: "--video-output-levels=limited --video-rotate=90"
    --rexec-before  Execute the specified script via 'sh' just before the connection
    --rexec-exit    Execute the specified script via 'sh' before exiting the script
    --rexec-late    Execute the specified script via 'sh' after input(s) forward, before video grab



Examples:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Peter connecting to jserver, all defaults accepted
    ssh-rdp.sh --user venkman --server jserver

Raymond connecting to jserver on ssh port 322, streaming the display 0.0
    remote setup is dual head and Raymond selects the right monitor.
    Stream will be 128kbps for audio and 10000kbps for video:
    Ex: ssh-rdp.sh -u stantz -s jserver -p 322 -d 0.0 -r 1920x1080 -o +1920,0 -f 60 -a 128 -v 10000

Egon connecting to jserver on ssh port 322, streaming the display 0.0
    Stream will be 128kbps for audio and 10000kbps for video:
    Egon wants untouched audio, 144fps and encode via intelgpu, he needs to correct video output levels
    Ex: ssh-rdp.sh -u spengler -s jserver -p 322 -d 0.0 -f 144 -v 80000 --audioenc pcm --videoenc intelgpu --vplayeropts "--video-output-levels=limited"
      
     
I'm open to suggestions to make this software better!
